<h1>Markdown to HTML</h1>
<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It was developed by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 and is now widely used in documentation, emails, and other online content. Markdown allows you to format your text using simple syntax, such as asterisks or underscores for emphasis, and hashtags for headings. It is often used to create documentation for software projects, write blog posts, and create README files for GitHub repositories. There are also many tools and libraries available for working with Markdown, such as the Python package markdown which allows you to convert Markdown to HTML.</p>
